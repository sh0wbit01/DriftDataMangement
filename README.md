# DriftDataMangement

To model the drift  generate synthetic datasets that are closer to real datasets.Below is a universally accepted dataset for drift learning research....
This dataset consists of 50000 instances with three attributes of which only two are relevant. The two class decision boundary is given by f1 + f2 = b, where f1, f2 are the two relevant features and b a predefined threshold. Abrupt drift is simulated with four different concepts, by changing the value of b every 12500 samples. Also included are 10% of noise.
Deep Neural Network constructs its hidden layer and hidden node on its own with drift.self learning deep learning network.
